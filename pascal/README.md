# Enhancement library 🗣️lang-pascal

Pascal is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Niklaus Wirth in the early 1970s. 
This language was developed for teaching programming as a systematic discipline and to develop reliable and efficient programs.
It was my first language I've learned.
